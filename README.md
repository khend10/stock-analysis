# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to analyze stock data using Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to calculate total daily volume and returns (%) for the following stock: AY, CSIQ, DQ, ENPH, FSLR, HASI, JKS, RUN, SEDG, SPWR, TERP, VSLR. Stock data was gathered from 1/1/2017 through 12/31/2018 and used to calculate the metrics used in the stock analysis. The goal is create a model that could process thousands of stock by refactoring code to perform 'for loop' functions for larger datasets.

## Results: 

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

In summary the advantage to refactoring includes simplifying code to iterate through large data and perform calculations in a short amount of time. However, the disadvantage is that the code takes longer to develop and has more room for error when compared to doing each step at a time. For example, the syntax is sensitive and could become frustrating when troubleshooting. 

The pros to refactoring the code were the efficiency of taking code and configuring it to run through each of the stock. In addition, 
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
